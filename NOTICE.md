# Third-party notice

Most rules in the data file (`rules.bin`) were computed by the package author. Some are, or
descend from, rules published by others. The catalog `index.tsv` (column `origin`) and the
`source_id` of each rule in `rules.bin` say which; `ruleinfo` reports it at run time. The relations are:

* **transcribed** — the published rule itself, copied in; no search of the author's was involved;
* **same-rule** — the author's search converged to a rule identical to a published one (matched
  node for node, for GH up to a rotation); the rule belongs to the cited source;
* **derived** — the author's node elimination started from a published rule for the same
  `(d, p)` and went below its node count; the count is new, the starting point is theirs.

Anyone using one of these rules should cite the source named in its `origin`. Full references
are in `docs/src/credits.md` of Quadriceps.jl.

## Rules derived from Diallo and Worku's data (MIT license)

The Le rules `d = 2, p = 77` and `d = 3, p = 27, 29, …, 45` descend from the rules of
M. Diallo and Z. A. Worku, *High-order symmetric positive interior quadrature rules on two and
three dimensional domains*, arXiv:2601.14488 (2026), data at
`github.com/mdiallo-fula/SymmetricPositiveInteriorCubatures.jl`, which is released under the
MIT license. Those rules are modified copies in the sense of that license, whose notice
follows and applies to them:

## Rule transcribed from Festa and Sommariva

The Le rule `d = 2, p = 25` (113 nodes) is rule SMR25 of M. Festa and A. Sommariva, *Computing
almost minimal formulas on the square*, J. Comput. Appl. Math. 236 (2012) 4296–4302, taken from
J. Burkardt's `square_minimal_rule` port (distributed by its author under the MIT license) and
mapped to `[0,1]²` with weights summing to 1. The Le rules `d = 2, p = 9, 13, 15` coincide with
their SMR09, SMR13 and SMR15 but were produced by the author's own solver; nothing was copied.

## Rules transcribed from closed forms in the literature

GH `d = 2, p = 9` (Haegemans and Piessens 1977), `d = 2, p = 11` (Haegemans and Piessens 1976),
`d = 2, p = 13` (Cools and Haegemans 1988), `d = 3, p = 5` (Stroud 1971) and `d = 5, p = 5`
(Stroud and Secrest 1963) are the published rules, copied in.
